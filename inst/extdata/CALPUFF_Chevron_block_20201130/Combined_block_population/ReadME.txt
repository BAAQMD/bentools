This 2020 population projection is created by the following steps:
1. run PopGRID using the combined block definition to estimate the 2010 Censes based block-level population
2. import PopGRID 2010 block level population estimates into BenMAP-CE
3. Use BenMAP-CE to project 2020 population (based on Woods & Poole (2015))
